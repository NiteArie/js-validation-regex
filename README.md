# js-validation-regex

## General Info

In this challenge, you'd create a javascript validation script to validate the inputs entered by a user using RegEx.

You could always refer to the Regular Expression Library for support

For this project, there'd be three required inputs for validation:

The first would require the user to enter five (5) capital letters, six (6) symbols and two hyphens (-) in any order. This could be used as a password.
The second which could be used as username would require the user to enter letters without spaces
The third which could be used as email address would require the user to enter only email addresses on gmail (...@gmail.com).

## User Stories

* [X] User should be notified of any invalid inputs by error messages displayed on the form.
* [ ] The submit button on the form would never be executed until all entries are validated.
